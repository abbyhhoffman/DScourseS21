\section{Webscraping National Parks}

My Grandpa and I are planning a trip to in May to see Mount Rushmore. It is one of the national monuments on his bucket list still yet to be crossed off. I decided I want to use some of my free time throughout my lifespan to travel to see all the national parks since my grandparents couldn't before my Grandma got sick. With 63 parks I have to get started soon!

The data I parsed helps identify how many are located in each state/ territory and helps narrow the travel to 30 states. I used the online tutorial from Grant McDermott, I really liked the gifs which helped remind me which steps to go through to webscrape the WIKIPEDIA page. 

\section{Webscraping with API for Federal Reserve of St. Louis}

I found data for Washington's minimum wage rates from 1976 to 2021 from the St. Louis Federal Reserve website. As with government date, it required my API key to ensure no foul play. I found the way minimum wage has raised from 1.6 to an average 13.70 an hour. It appeared that big spikes coincided with political years as well. Washington is worth continued watching because of the 15 an hour mandate set back in 2014.

I used the following packages: 
library(ggplot2)
library(fredr)
library(tidyverse)
library(quantmod).
